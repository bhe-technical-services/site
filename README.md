### retrospective notes/to-do/improvements, from last projects
- Design was a pain point. The worst part, in fact, make steps to create a process.
- Create & use common code snippets, using the snippets [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inu1255.easy-snippet) mentioned in [syntax](https://syntax.fm/show/278/potluck-mdx-portfolio-projects-code-commenting-css-properties-reusable-components-more)
- create a template/tutorial/process to implement dark mode using tailwind, on all sites going forward.
- make sure the file structure for images is designed/in place before code starts, because it got pretty sloppy with the DIFTK project, and that's just boring to clean up.
